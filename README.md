# DesignPatterns
A simple project testing all the types of design patterns.

#Patterns Added So Far
###1. Observer Pattern
    GoF Definition: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so 
    that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
    and updated automatically.

###2. Singleton Pattern
    GoF Definition: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a 
    global point of access to it.
    
###3. Proxy Pattern
    GoF Definition: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object
    to control access to it.
